# Angle-Sensor-Data-Acquisition
This device uses the ADXL337 accelerometer and the Esduino Xtreme microcontroller.  The system processes analog input data, converts it to digital data, then outputs it through serial communication on the PC using MATLAB.  The program is coded in C using Code Warrior, and uses 10 bit resolution for AD conversion.
